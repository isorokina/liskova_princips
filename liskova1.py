# Liskov Substitution Principle
# Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program 
'''
As we can see here, we are trying to loop through a list of car objects. And here we break the Liskov Substitution principle as 
we cannot replace Super type Carâ€™s objects with objects of Sub type PetrolCar in the function written to find Red cars.
